# Scripts

- `stream_explore_knn.py`: experiment the KNNRegressor model by intermittently training and testing
- `stream_data_creator.py`: collect training data and store it in the `data` folder
- `data_explore_knn.py`: use the contents of the `data` folder to train and test the KNNRegressor model

In order to execute the scripts, run `python3 -m <module folder>/scripts/<script name>.py` on the parent folder where the repo is located.
